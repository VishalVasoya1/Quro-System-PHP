<h3> Introduction </h3>

QuroSystem is a new shopping system that makes shopping easier and more convenient for customers by using QR codes. With this system, customers can scan the QR code of each item they want to purchase and add it to their digital cart. At the end of their shopping trip, customers can make payments for all the items in their cart. The shopping mall employees will then gather all the items and provide them to the customer in one place, eliminating the need for customers to carry around their purchases throughout the mall.

This system provides several benefits to customers, including a faster and more convenient shopping experience, reduced waiting times, and the ability to easily keep track of purchases. By implementing this system, shopping malls can enhance the shopping experience for customers and increase customer satisfaction. Additionally, the use of QR codes can help with tracking inventory and reducing theft.

Overall, your project has the potential to revolutionize the shopping experience in shopping malls and make it more convenient and enjoyable for customers.
