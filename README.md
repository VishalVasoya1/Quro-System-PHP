<h3> Introduction </h3>

QuroSystem is a new shopping system that makes shopping easier and more convenient for customers by using QR codes. With this system, customers can scan the QR code of each item they want to purchase and add it to their digital cart. At the end of their shopping trip, customers can make payments for all the items in their cart. The shopping mall employees will then gather all the items and provide them to the customer in one place, eliminating the need for customers to carry around their purchases throughout the mall.

This system provides several benefits to customers, including a faster and more convenient shopping experience, reduced waiting times, and the ability to easily keep track of purchases. By implementing this system, shopping malls can enhance the shopping experience for customers and increase customer satisfaction. Additionally, the use of QR codes can help with tracking inventory and reducing theft.

Overall, your project has the potential to revolutionize the shopping experience in shopping malls and make it more convenient and enjoyable for customers.

</h3>Problem:</h3>
Shopping in malls can be a time-consuming and tiring experience for customers. They often have to carry heavy shopping bags and wait in long queues to make payments. This can be frustrating and discourages customers from returning to the shopping mall. Shopping mall staff also face challenges in managing inventory and ensuring that customers have a smooth and efficient checkout experience.

<h3>Solution:</h3>
Our QR code system provides a solution to these problems by offering a more convenient and efficient shopping experience for customers. By using QR codes, customers can easily scan items they want to purchase and add them to their digital cart. They can make payments for all their purchases at once, and shopping mall staff will then gather all items in one place for the customers. This eliminates the need for customers to carry heavy shopping bags or wait in long queues to make payments.

To address the challenges that shopping mall staff face in managing inventory and ensuring a smooth checkout experience, our system includes an employee panel with various features such as stock management, product management, and cashier services. The stock manager can monitor inventory levels and reorder products when needed. The product manager can update product information and add new products to the system. The cashier can manage payments and transactions, ensuring that customers have a smooth and efficient checkout experience.

<h3>Metrics:</h3>
To measure the success and improvement of our QR code system, we will use the following metrics:

`Customer satisfaction:` We will conduct surveys or collect feedback from customers who have used the system to identify areas for improvement and enhance the customer experience.

Time savings: We will measure the amount of time saved by customers by not having to wait in long queues, carry shopping bags, or manually enter orders. This will help us quantify the impact of our system on customer convenience.

Revenue: We will monitor the revenue generated by the system and compare it to revenue generated by traditional methods. This will help us identify the profitability and sustainability of the system.

Adoption rate: We will measure the rate at which customers are adopting the system and using it instead of traditional methods. This will help us identify the effectiveness of the system in meeting customer needs and expectations.

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
Our QR code system is a new and innovative solution that can help shopping malls enhance the shopping experience for customers and improve the efficiency of their operations. By measuring the success and improvement of the system, we can continually refine and optimize it to better meet customer needs and drive business growth.
